# CNN with Numpy
This is the NumPy implementation of CNN, including Conv FC Dropout and BN layer, etc.

## Reconstruct
1. I am now trying to reconstruct it to follow up with the new technology used in CNN.
2. I want to add some detailed image descriptions to each structure of CNN.


| structure  |   image descriptions   |  Dir   |
| ----        |  ----    |  ----    | 
| CNN | ![](README/CNN_explain.PNG) | layers/Conv/README.md |
